Here's a step-by-step walkthrough for downloading a CentOS ISO file and creating a bootable USB drive:
Downloading CentOS ISO File

    Visit the Official CentOS Website:
        Open your web browser and go to the official CentOS website: https://www.centos.org/.

    Select the Desired Version:
        Depending on your needs, you can choose between CentOS Stream and CentOS Linux. For this walkthrough, we'll focus on CentOS Linux.

    Choose the ISO File:
        Once you've selected your desired version, you'll be presented with download options. Look for the ISO files. Typically, you'll see two main types:
            DVD ISO: This is a full installation image that contains everything you need to install the OS on a system.
            Minimal ISO: A smaller image that installs the bare minimum to get CentOS running. You can install additional packages later.

    Download the ISO File:
        Click on the download link for the ISO file you want to download. The download will start automatically.

    Verify the Download (Optional but Recommended):
        For security reasons, it's a good idea to verify your download. The CentOS website provides checksum values (like SHA256) that you can compare against your downloaded file.
        Use a tool like sha256sum on Linux to verify the checksum.

        bash

        sha256sum /path/to/your/downloaded.iso

        Compare the output with the checksum provided on the website. If they match, your download is genuine.

Creating a Bootable CentOS USB Drive

    Insert a USB Drive:
        Plug in a USB drive that has at least the size of the ISO file you downloaded (8GB or more is recommended).

    Determine the USB Drive's Name:
        On a Linux system, you can use the lsblk command to list all storage devices.
        Identify your USB drive by its size or name. It will typically be named something like /dev/sdb.

    Flash the ISO to the USB Drive:
        Use a tool like dd to flash the ISO to the USB drive. Be very careful with this command; using the wrong device name can erase data.

        bash

        sudo dd if=/path/to/your/downloaded.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress && sync

        Replace /path/to/your/downloaded.iso with the actual path to your ISO file and /dev/sdX with your USB drive's name (e.g., /dev/sdb).

    Safely Remove the USB Drive:
        Once the dd command completes, you can safely remove the USB drive from your computer.

    Boot from the USB Drive:
        Insert the USB drive into the computer you want to install CentOS on.
        Reboot the computer and select the USB drive from the boot menu. The exact method varies depending on the manufacturer, but often you'll press a key like F12, F2, or ESC during startup.
        Follow the on-screen instructions to install CentOS.

That's it! You've successfully downloaded the CentOS ISO file and created a bootable USB drive. Now you can use this USB drive to install CentOS on any compatible machine.
